# Welcome to Trail Keeper!
In the same way a trail must be followed, goals are achieved through consistent choices—one step, one decision, one day at a time. In a world that often demands instant results and promotes an 'all or nothing' mentality, I have to remind myself that progress is built steadily, not in leaps, but in the quiet persistence of each small action.

Trail Keeper is a goal-setting app designed to help you navigate your personal journey toward success. Much like following a path through the forest, Trail Keeper keeps you on track as you break down your goals into manageable steps. 

Whether you are aiming for personal development, fitness, or career milestones, Trail Keeper offers a serene, nature-inspired interface where you can plot your course, mark your progress, and celebrate your achievements. Stay motivated, stay focused, and let Trail Keeper guide you toward the summit of your goals.
